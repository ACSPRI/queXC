#queXC

An Open Source, web based data cleaning and coding system

queXC cleans and codes qualitative and other textual data (such as data collected from a questionnaire). Multiple operators can work on a single data file using only a web browser. Coding schemes can be created on the fly or imported.

queXC takes a data file (such as data collected from a questionnaire) and cleans the text input fields (qualitative data or other textual data) by spacing them and spell checking them. queXC then allows operators to code the text to existing coding schemes, or to create a coding scheme on the fly. Multiple operators can code and clean simultaneously, including the ability to assign operators to do particular codes. The queXC system includes some coding schemes created from ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) data.

Development for queXC occurs on Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/quexc
